Hello, can you briefly introduce yourself? Say your name, age, where you live and what you’re doing right now.
Hi, I’m Teresa Amorim, I’m 26 years old, and I’m currently living in Porto. I’m a court officer working at the Matosinhos Court, in the section specialized in domestic violence.

This interview will focus mainly on your relationship with activism. So, when and how did your involvement in activism begin?
I started getting more involved in activism when I entered university, around 2016. During my first year at university, I was a bit depressed and disenchanted with everything and I enrolled in law but didn’t like it very much.
It was only when I switched to criminology in 2017 that I began to open up and had more mental space to dedicate myself to other things besides university. That’s when an opposition list was formed for the academic association elections at the University of Minho. That’s how I met people who also liked activism, enjoyed taking part in demonstrations and were also politically engaged.
One thing led to another, and the first major action I got seriously involved in was organizing the International Feminist Strike in Braga on March 8. From there on, I got involved in everything. That same year, in 2018, 2019, more demonstrations started happening in Braga. I also began participating in "Fridays for Future" and the "Student Climate Strike".
Later, I also got involved in the LGBT movement as I came to realize that I’m a queer person. So one thing led to another, and suddenly I was involved in pretty much every activist effort happening in Braga.

Did your family or friends influence your decision to get involved in activism?
At the time, in terms of friendships, I interacted mostly with people from my course, there wasn’t really anyone else who wanted to get involved in activism, so I ended up feeling a bit alone in it. So, in terms of friendships, not really. It was only later that I started building more connections within activism. But at the time, before getting involved, there wasn’t anyone supporting me.
Regarding family, especially my father, he was very supportive. He liked seeing me becoming more engaged and opening up more because being in activism broadens your perspective on life. It brought me into new groups and connections that I didn’t have before, I used to be much more reserved and introverted. Activism really changed that.

Now, regarding organizations and causes, which movements are you currently involved in?
With the recent move to a new city, I haven’t been as active as before. Ccurrently, I’m more active in UMAR (Alternative and Response Women’s Union), also in the "Rede 8 de Março", "Braga Fora do Armário", the "Joint Anti-Racist Action" group, and the "Academy for Palestine". Regarding the "Academy for Palestine", we’re not very active at the moment, but we still organize and help run weekly vigils for Palestine. I think those are the groups I’m most active at the moment.

How did you learn about these organizations? Why are they important to you? Can you talk a little bit about that?
Back then, the knowledge came mainly through the people I was involved with in things more related to the university, trying to organize protests, make things happen starting from the University of Minho. At that time, many collectives weren’t even formally established in Braga. That desire to do things in Braga helped create a broader network, like "Rede 8 de Março", where we ended up creating a local branch here in Braga.
As for the others, UMAR, for example, was one of the first organizations I got involved with and felt connected to. It was also through the "Rede 8 de Março". Basically, the activist community in Braga is pretty interconnected, it’s almost the same people taking turns in different groups.
Word of mouth is how you learn about the groups, and how new groups are being created. Most groups — except for "Braga Fora do Armário", which has existed for many years in Braga - like "Grupo da Ação Conjunta", "Rede 8 de Março", and the "Greve Climática Estudantil", they were all groups that emerged organically among people who wanted to take action. And it’s easier to formalize things by creating an Instagram account to promote the events and activities we organize.
As for why I’m still involved in these groups and why they are important for me. I think it’s really that moment when you start seeing things, when you begin to become aware, not only of how everything impacts you, but also how it affects other people differently. You start gaining awareness of the various layers of oppression. You become conscious of how society works, and, in the end, you become more politicized. You end up not being able to stay in just one movement, you want to get involved in all of them, or at least try to be part of several causes.
That’s why activism is still important to me, it gives me the motivation to keep going. I believe it’s necessary to stay engaged and active in everything.

What does your day-to-day involvement in these causes usually look like? When do you normally take part?
Right now, I’m mostly involved through WhatsApp groups, there are many of them. Honestly, I can’t keep up with all of them because people send a lot of messages per day. But in the things where I’m really needed, where an opinion is required or they’re planning to take some specific action, I try to respond as much as possible.
I also try to attend meetings whether to prepare events or demonstrations or just to provide an update with the groups. Weekends are when I dedicate more time to activism. It’s my free time, and I still commit part of it to activism, demonstrations and vigils when I go to Braga.This is how I am at the moment.
It’s also important to talk about these movements. In other words, even though I’m in a workplace, whenever I get the chance, I also talk about the collectives that exist and see if anyone else is interested.

Is there a particularly meaningful experience you've had in activism that stands out to you?
There are many, but one of the most impactful recent moments was related to the Palestinian cause at the University of Minho. I met someone who became a friend, she’s Palestinian and studying at the university. I met this person at a protest, and she shared her testimony. She showed up at the protest because I was managing one of the collective’s social media accounts, and she had messaged me at the time asking if she could participate. I said, of course!
I didn’t expect her to come and share her story so viscerally. After that, we kept in touch and became closer. Since the beginning, she said she really wanted to give me her keffiyeh, the Palestinian scarf she’d had since she was four.
She had worn it in protests and with her family in Palestine. She wanted me to have it as a way of passing her story to someone who’s fighting for the Palestinian cause here, a cause that, for her, is literally about life or death.
It was very emotional. That’s the object I brought here today. For the past two years, I’ve worn it every day to work and protests.
It also helps ease the longing for her, since she’s now back in Palestine and wants to return to Portugal. Hopefully, she’ll be able to!

So, what object did you bring and what does it mean to you?
Here it is. It’s a bit rolled up now because I didn’t wear it today, it’s very hot. But it’s always with me. It’s quite old and fragile now.
At the time, Masha told me to wear it. It wasn’t meant to be kept at home, she really wanted me to use it. I’ve sent her pictures of me at protests, always showing the keffiyeh with me.
This object for me represents resistance, liberation, and unity across borders. It’s an important symbol of resistance not only for Palestinians but for everyone.
In activism, I believe if you’re fighting for many causes and not also for the liberation of Palestine, then something is wrong. This struggle for the liberation of Palestine made me realize that it’s almost a deal-breaker within activism.
It’s when people really show who they are. When the Palestine cause comes up, that’s when you truly see who wants liberation for all peoples, who believes in intersectional struggle, and who is not on that side of the fight.

Have you faced any obstacles or difficulties in activism? If so, how did you overcome them?
In terms of obstacles, I think there are two levels. There are obstacles within the organization itself, meaning in terms of its structure and functioning. It is understood that it should always be a horizontal organization—that is, everyone speaks, everyone gives their opinion, and everyone tries to manage things autonomously, so to speak, self-managing the movement.
The challenges that come with this are really the different personalities, the different points of view, and even age gaps. Sometimes, there’s also a generational clash within the collectives. It can be complicated to manage all these emotions to move in a common direction. That’s why meetings can be very exhausting, especially when we’re trying to build the manifesto or develop an idea we want to present. I think it also wears people down emotionally and psychologically, which leads to burnout caused by activism, and that’s something very real. Many friends have had to step away from activism for a while because of this.
So I would say that one of the challenges is being able to manage ourselves as activists, but also to manage our relationships with others, our comrades, with whom we’re trying to build something and envision a better future.
Externally, the main challenge is confrontation. One moment that stands out was a counter-protest in Guimarães.
There was a demonstration by the fascist group “1143,” and it was one of those times you feel truly vulnerable.
Police pointed guns at us, activists who were peacefully playing music and singing “Grândola Vila Morena.” But the aggression was aimed at us. That was a harsh reality check.
That’s why I believe activism is more important than ever right now. We’re at a turning point. It’s vital to be united, and the more of us there are, the stronger we become against such forces.

How do you see the future of these causes?
I like to think I’m a bit utopian. Maybe not truly pessimistic, more realistic.
When it comes to activism, I like to think that in a few years, or in the near future, it will become increasingly unanimous that activism is essential for us to evolve as a society, to grow as individuals, and to be able to build—or imagine—a future different from what is presented to us today.
So, I want to believe that, just like we had the Carnation Revolution, or other revolutions around the world, maybe it’s through this collective unity, this popular union, this resistance, that we will be able to turn things around. And I want to believe that being an activist in the future will be something everyone can identify with and say it proudly. Not the kind of activist in that old stereotype that many people have — people who are idle, don’t work, are kind of hippies, and just want to live in a somewhat dystopian society —because that’s not true.
Activists work, have their own lives, families, and relational dynamics just like anyone else, and I think it’s really commendable that they take some of their time to dedicate to this. I’d like more people to feel — not exactly obligated - but to have the desire to join in, especially in celebrations like the Carnation Revolution, where I think even more people should participate.

What advice would you give someone who wants to start participating in activism?
Based on my experience, my biggest advice is to identify connections within your daily routines. So, if you live in a city — let’s say Porto, for example — be aware of social media or also those places where you can tell people connected to activism hang out. For example, knowing there will be a debate about Palestine at a specific café. If you feel comfortable with that, try to show up at those places, because often it’s by being physically present at activities that we get to know people and find out who’s organizing the collectives, protests, events, popular assemblies, or whatever it may be.
At least from my experience, it’s really through in-person contact that we get to know people and slowly start getting involved in activities. And, as I said, if we’re studying at a university, there are definitely collectives and people trying to organize things there too.
So, I think it’s a bit like that: trying within our own communities and the places closest to us, to build other communities or create other movements. That’s my recommendation.

Lastly, is there anything else you’d like to share that we haven’t covered?
I don’t think so. I think we touched on everything.
We’ll end here, then. Thank you!
